# This text file should explain how to deploy your website.

# You should write detailed description on:

# 1. All the packages you need to install
# 2. How to configure various servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache, etc)

To run the backend server you must have Django 4.2.6 instealled and all of the other dependencies that are in the `requirements.txt` file in /backend
To activate the backend environment, download all dependencies, and run all migrations, cd into `/backend` and run `source startup.sh`
To run the backend server, run `source run.sh` in the /backend directory as well. 

To run the frontend server you must have node and nvm installed on your local setup.
You can install nvm v0.39.5 and use node v16.13.1. This will give you access to the node modules we used.
In order to install the dependencies we used in the frontened run `npm i` or `npm  install` in the `/frontend` repository.
After all of the node modules are installed, you can now run the fronend server using the command `npm start` in the `/frontend` repository
You can now go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
In the .env in frontend make sure you have the proper IP address that points to the backend. For the localhost backend use http://localhost:8000, for the production database use http://137.184.5.118:3000/
